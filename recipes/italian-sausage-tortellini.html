                <p>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water 
                to a boil and generously salt. To the 
                skillet, saut√© the shallots until translucent 
                then add the garlic and cook until just 
                beginning to brown and become fragrant. Deglaze 
                the pan with the lemon juice. Add the cream, red 
                pepper, black pepper, and salt. Scrape the pan to 
                get all the fond off the bottom and mix with the
